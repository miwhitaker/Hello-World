                Every force in the universe can be grouped into one of the following four forces 
                (ordered from weakest to strongest):
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gravity</li>
                    <li>Electromagnetic</li>
                    <li>Weak Nuclear Force</li>
                    <li>Strong Nuclear Force</li>
                </ol>
            <p>
                Most people are at least somewhat familiar with the first two, but the
                other two are relatively unknown to most.

                    This is the force we all learn about in school.  It's what keeps our feet on the ground
                    and the earth in orbit around the sun.
                </p>
                    <h2>Electromagnetic</h2>

                <p class="section text">
                    This is the force responsible for the electrical power we all use and the force that
                    keeps your feet from falling through the floor. Most people have seen magnets and used
                    electrical power, but didn't realize they are like the head or tails on a coin: different
                    manifestations of the <strong>same force</strong>.
                </p>
                    <h2>Weak Nuclear Force</h2>
                        <a href="https://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/exo/images/2nbb_decay.gif">
                        Beta decay</a>
                <p class="section text">
                    This is a lesser known force that only acts at short range <em>near the nucleus of an atom.
                    </em>It is responsible for some types of nuclear radiation, such as beta rays (a neutron
                    decaying into a proton, electron and an antineutrino)
                </p>
                    <h2>Strong Nuclear Force</h2>
                        <a href="https://futurism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/439407608_6401.jpg"><img src=

                <p class="section text">
                    This is also a lesser known force that only operates <em>near an atomic nucleus</em>. 
                    It is the force that holds together the nucleus of an atom when the positive charge of
                    protons should repel them away. Our model for strong interactions gives rise to these 
                    properties for hadrons:
